        //all devices layout All of us have dreams. Dreams can be a powerful
        tool to understand oneself and are an infinite source of
        inspiration. The Dream log app is here to help you to keep track of your
        dreams. //dream log We encourage you to write your dreams every morning
        as soon as you wake up. Give your dream a memorable title and write a
        short story about that adventure. You can categorize your dream as
        Lucid, Normal, or Nightmare.   //add dream Some dreams are worth
        sharing. Add your dreams to your dream blog by making them public and
        share the link with your friends and family. You can change the privacy
        of any dream, anytime. //dream blog Your dream statistics on the app
        will show the rate at which you have one type of dream over the others,
        how many hours of sleep you get, and what your average sleeping hours
        per dream type are. //staistics We keep your personal dream statistics
        ready, right on your page any time you want to get a better
        understanding of your dream data. Join our Dream log family today and
