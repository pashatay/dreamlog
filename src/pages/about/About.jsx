          All of us have dreams. Dreams can be a powerful tool to understand
          oneself and are an infinite source of inspiration.Â The Dream log app
          is here to help you to keep track of your dreams.
        </p>

        <p>
          We encourage you to write your dreams every morning as soon as you
          wake up. Give your dream a memorable title and write a short story
          about that adventure. You can categorize your dream as Lucid, Normal,
          or Nightmare.
        </p>

          Some dreams are worth sharing. Add your dreams to your dream blog by
          making them public and share the link with your friends and family.

          Your dream statistics on the app will show the rate at which you have
          one type of dream over the others, how many hours of sleep you get,
          and what your average sleeping hours per dream type are.
