Dream Log App is a dream journal/blog. Itâ€™s compatible with any device.

Dream log can be used by users in two different ways - as a registred user and as a guest. Guest user can only read someone's dream blog while registred user can store his dreams, add dreams to a dream blog, view personal dream statistics etc.

In order to start using **Dream Log** in full, you need to sign up for an account. As soon as you sign up, **Dream Log** will email you a verification link. Click the link and you're all set!

To add your first dream click on the "add dream" button. You can only add your last night dream/dreams. There is no way to add dreams from the past because all added dreams will be dated as of today. That's why we encourage you to include dream journaling into your morning rutine.
